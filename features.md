### [Attribute-based access control (ABAC)](https://secberus.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PROD/pages/2848980993/ABAC+User+stories) - [STRAT-32](https://secberus.atlassian.net/browse/STRAT-32)
Attribute-based access control (ABAC) offers improved security and flexibility by evaluating more than just roles for authorization decisions. Attributes can include user attributes (e.g., security clearance, age), resource attributes (e.g., creation date, type of resource) and context (e.g., access location, time of day).
